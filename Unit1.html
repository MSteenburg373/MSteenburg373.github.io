	<h3 align="center" title="*SNORE*">About Me!</h3>
	<p align="center">I'm just a 32-year-young woman who never yet achieved a degree, though I have had an interesting run of
		life, and came back to do just that!

		<br>
 <br>
  
    I am not sure where this skill falls in an Office Manager degree but it seems quite interesting. 
    
 <br>
    
    I'm probably somewhere lower than beginner as far as coding so I look forward to trying something new! 
    
<br>

    Well, let me try to come up with some facts about me and see if this <i>"ol' dog"</i> can still learn some new tricks!</p>

     <p> <b>Other fun facts:</b> I have recently taken up painting and have done 11 pieces so far (I believe is the count) it has been a very relaxing and fun experience. I love to try and learn new things. I enjoy cooking and baking. I love the band Mumford & Sons and my grandmother, mother, and I love to follow a group called The Tartan Terrors. they always put on a great show!</p>
